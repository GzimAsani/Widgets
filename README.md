# Widgets


- The purpose of this app was to test my skills with react hooks. In this app I created 4 different pages where I included searchbar, column selecting, searching from different API, dropdown. In this app I used minimal css because as I mentioned the purpose was to show my knoledge in creating different components and connecting them by using hooks
